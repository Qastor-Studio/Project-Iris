Iris will fetch web contents from greasyfork.org and renders UI (including simple calculations), allowing you to save and run them locally.

Iris will not intentionally edit contents. Iris is not responsible for the datas on this website, and the website is not responsible for Iris. Malicious scripts may steal your web data, you need to take responsibility for the risks brought by the script. Not all extensions run well on watchOS.

Sunrise and sunset time are based on your location. Location information is a highly-sensitive data, and we attach great importance to your privacy. When using this feature, we need to get your approximate location. Your location will be randomly shifted 1-20 kilometers by watchOS in order to protect your privacy. We cannot get your accurate location.

Iris will do geometrical calculations locally, getting your today's sunrise and sunset time. There may be a deviation of about 2 minutes between sunrise and sunset.
